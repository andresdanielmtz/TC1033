#  TC1003
## Final Project, Object Oriented Computational Thinking, ITESM.

This project is the mockup of what a real hospital database system would look like. In this case, you can add patients and based on the data you input, the program will tell you if the patient is in a critical state or not, or if the patient has symptoms related to COVID-19. All of these results stored in both text files called `riesgo.txt` and `covid.txt`, respectively. 
To run this project, please use `g++ o <name> main.cpp` and `./<name>`.
